You may apply to the Professional Program before completing all the required courses in the Pre-Professional Program. This preliminary acceptance is contingent on completing the required courses with a C grade or better. A preliminary acceptance to the Professional Program will allow you to enroll in upper-division courses. If you have not completed a course in the pre-professional program, list the grade as a C when filling out the application and include that placeholder grade when computing your GPA. A GPA of 2.8 is still required for acceptance to the professional program. If your GPA falls below 2.8 with these placeholder C grades, wait until you have the final grades after taking the courses before you apply.

If you are a transfer student, please contact the program coordinator or advisors on how to fill out the application.

### Dismissal from the program

We are deeply committed to nurturing our students' academic growth and success within the ECE Program. To maintain the rigorous standards and high-quality education our program offers, there is a specific policy concerning the repetition of courses.

Students in the pre-professional and professional programs may be placed on probation if they withdraw (without justification) or earn a grade lower than C twice in any one ECE course. Students on probation require a department override to register for any ECE course. If a student fails to pass a course (with a grade of C or higher) a third time, he or she will be dismissed from the program.

This will be implemented through the following steps:

- If a student is in the Pre-Professional program, the student will not be eligible for admission into the Professional Program, thereby preventing the student from taking upper-division ECE courses.
- If a student is in the Professional Program, the student will be removed from the program and will not be allowed to take any further ECE courses.

By upholding this standard, we provide a clear educational pathway to graduation, ensuring that our graduates from Weber State University are well-prepared and knowledgeable as they embark on a career in industry.

The policy encourages students to utilize the comprehensive support services available at Weber State University. We believe in offering a robust support system, including academic advising, tutoring, and counseling, to help students overcome obstacles and thrive in their studies. Seeking assistance promptly often enables students to address their concerns effectively, preventing the need for course repetition and allowing them to maintain their progress in the ECE Programs.

There is an established appeals process when students face exceptional circumstances that may have affected their academic performance. Students can provide relevant documentation and appeal to the Academic Review Board, ensuring that individual cases are thoroughly examined and decisions are made fairly and equitably.

By adhering to this policy, we uphold the reputation and integrity of Weber State University's ECE Programs. This commitment ensures that our graduates possess exceptional technical skills and demonstrate resilience, determination, and adaptability, making them well-prepared for the challenges of the professional world in Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering.

## Academic integrity

In the ECE Department, we uphold the highest academic integrity and ethical conduct standards. As future engineers and innovators, it is paramount that our students understand the significance of maintaining honesty, trust, and respect within the academic community. Academic integrity violations undermine our department's core values and erode the foundation upon which our educational system is built.

One of our department's specific areas of concern is the unauthorized sharing of course materials, including source code, assignments, and project files. While collaboration and knowledge sharing are encouraged within the boundaries of each course, students must recognize the importance of respecting the intellectual property rights associated with their coursework. This includes refraining from publicly posting course code or any other class-related materials, even after the course has concluded.

### Consequences

Academic integrity violations are treated with the utmost seriousness in the ECE Department. Such actions compromise the learning process, diminish the value of the education received, and can lead to severe consequences. Students violating these policies may face disciplinary measures ranging from receiving a failing grade for the assignment or course to suspension or expulsion from the university. Additionally, academic integrity violations tarnish students' reputations, potentially impacting their future career prospects and professional relationships.

### Promoting a culture of integrity and responsibility

To promote a culture of academic integrity and responsibility, the ECE Department emphasizes the importance of understanding and abiding by university policies related to plagiarism, cheating, and unauthorized distribution of course materials. Faculty members employ various tools and techniques, including plagiarism detection software, to identify potential violations and ensure a fair and just academic environment for all students.

Furthermore, students are encouraged to actively engage with the principles of academic integrity and seek guidance from faculty members and academic advisors if they are uncertain about the appropriate collaboration and knowledge-sharing boundaries. By fostering an environment of open communication, mutual respect, and ethical conduct, we can collectively uphold the integrity of our department and nurture a community of engineers who are not only technically proficient but also ethically responsible leaders in their field.
