Note: at most, one 3000-level course can be an acceptable Senior Level elective.

### Five-Year BS/MS Programs

Both the Electrical and Computer Engineering BS programs are designed to mesh with their corresponding MS programs to make it possible to complete a BS degree and an MS degree in 5 years (150 credits). Students must maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 and must still apply for admission to graduate school, but they need not supply transcripts or take the GRE.

Most senior electives offered by the department are cross-listed with graduate courses with a similar number. For example, ECE 5710 and ECE 6710 are both titled "Real-Time Systems," but ECE 5710 is a senior elective, and ECE 6710 is a graduate course. Both are taught at the same time and place, but the students in the graduate course are required to do additional work commensurate with the graduate level. Undergraduate students can take up to 2 graduate courses (a maximum of 6 credits) and count them toward their undergraduate and graduate degrees.

Students in the MS program may choose the option of writing a thesis, doing a project or taking additional courses. Those students who plan to pursue a graduate degree with the project option may select an undergraduate capstone project that will transition into a Master's project.

### Dual Majors

Students may earn a second bachelor's degree in EE, CE, or BME in conjunction with or after completing one EE, CE, or BME degree with the following provisos:

- The senior project may, with departmental approval, be shared between two degrees if it is (was) applicable to both. BME students must see an advisor to slot BME 4010/4020 instead of ECE 4010/4020 or vice versa.
- At most two 5000-level elective courses may be shared. (i.e., up to two 5000-level elective courses may be slotted simultaneously in both programs.) Courses that are not 5000-level may not be shared. Also, any course that fills a non-elective requirement in one program may not count as an elective in another.
- For students pursuing a second degree in Biomedical Engineering, at least one of the electives must come from outside the ECE department. (If the biomedical degree was initially completed without such a course, the student must take the outside course and count one of the prior electives as a non-shared elective for the EE or CE degree.)
- Students may not earn a triple major of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering.

### Independent Studies

Independent studies are available to students who wish to pursue a topic not covered in the regular curriculum. The student must find a faculty member willing to supervise the study and must submit a proposal to the department chair for approval by the ECE Department faculty. The proposal must include a description of the work to be done, the expected outcome, and the method of evaluation. The student must meet with the faculty member at least once a week and must submit a written report at the end of the semester. The number of credits earned is determined by the amount of work done, but the maximum is 3 credits per semester. Independent studies may not be used to satisfy the senior project requirement.

### Dismissal from the program

We are deeply committed to nurturing our students' academic growth and success within the ECE Program. To maintain the rigorous standards and high-quality education our program offers, there is a specific policy concerning the repetition of courses.

Students in the pre-professional and professional programs may be placed on probation if they withdraw (without justification) or earn a grade lower than C twice in any one ECE course. Students on probation require a department override to register for any ECE course. If a student fails to pass a course (with a grade of C or higher) a third time, he or she will be dismissed from the program.

This will be implemented through the following steps:

- If a student is in the Pre-Professional program, the student will not be eligible for admission into the Professional Program, thereby preventing the student from taking upper-division ECE courses.
- If a student is in the Professional Program, the student will be removed from the program and will not be allowed to take any further ECE courses.

By upholding this standard, we provide a clear educational pathway to graduation, ensuring that our graduates from Weber State University are well-prepared and knowledgeable as they embark on a career in industry.

The policy encourages students to utilize the comprehensive support services available at Weber State University. We believe in offering a robust support system, including academic advising, tutoring, and counseling, to help students overcome obstacles and thrive in their studies. Seeking assistance promptly often enables students to address their concerns effectively, preventing the need for course repetition and allowing them to maintain their progress in the ECE Programs.

There is an established appeals process when students face exceptional circumstances that may have affected their academic performance. Students can provide relevant documentation and appeal to the Academic Review Board, ensuring that individual cases are thoroughly examined and decisions are made fairly and equitably.

By adhering to this policy, we uphold the reputation and integrity of Weber State University's ECE Programs. This commitment ensures that our graduates possess exceptional technical skills and demonstrate resilience, determination, and adaptability, making them well-prepared for the challenges of the professional world in Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering.

## Academic integrity

In the ECE Department, we uphold the highest academic integrity and ethical conduct standards. As future engineers and innovators, it is paramount that our students understand the significance of maintaining honesty, trust, and respect within the academic community. Academic integrity violations undermine our department's core values and erode the foundation upon which our educational system is built.

One of our department's specific areas of concern is the unauthorized sharing of course materials, including source code, assignments, and project files. While collaboration and knowledge sharing are encouraged within the boundaries of each course, students must recognize the importance of respecting the intellectual property rights associated with their coursework. This includes refraining from publicly posting course code or any other class-related materials, even after the course has concluded.

### Consequences

Academic integrity violations are treated with the utmost seriousness in the ECE Department. Such actions compromise the learning process, diminish the value of the education received, and can lead to severe consequences. Students violating these policies may face disciplinary measures ranging from receiving a failing grade for the assignment or course to suspension or expulsion from the university. Additionally, academic integrity violations tarnish students' reputations, potentially impacting their future career prospects and professional relationships.

### Promoting a culture of integrity and responsibility

To promote a culture of academic integrity and responsibility, the ECE Department emphasizes the importance of understanding and abiding by university policies related to plagiarism, cheating, and unauthorized distribution of course materials. Faculty members employ various tools and techniques, including plagiarism detection software, to identify potential violations and ensure a fair and just academic environment for all students.

Furthermore, students are encouraged to actively engage with the principles of academic integrity and seek guidance from faculty members and academic advisors if they are uncertain about the appropriate collaboration and knowledge-sharing boundaries. By fostering an environment of open communication, mutual respect, and ethical conduct, we can collectively uphold the integrity of our department and nurture a community of engineers who are not only technically proficient but also ethically responsible leaders in their field.

### Examples of academic misbehavior

The following is an incomplete list of examples of academic misbehavior. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and other forms of academic integrity violations may occur. It serves as a handful of examples to highlight the various violations students should be aware of.

- Plagiarism: Presenting someone else's work, ideas, or intellectual property as one's own without proper citation.
