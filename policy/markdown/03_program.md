# Program overview

## Mission and goals

The mission of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at Weber State is to educate students to become skilled and innovative engineers who contribute effectively to society. Our programs aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of electrical, computer, and biomedical engineering principles, foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and prepare graduates for successful careers in various industries or advanced studies in graduate school.

### Program learning outcomes

Upon completion of the ECE programs, students are expected to demonstrate the following learning outcomes:

- Apply mathematical, scientific, and engineering principles to solve complex electrical, computer, or biomedical engineering problems.
- Design and conduct experiments and analyze and interpret data in electrical, computer, or biomedical engineering domains.
- Design systems and components and integrate them into complex, realistic contexts.
- Work effectively in multidisciplinary teams, demonstrating communication, leadership, and project management skills.
- Recognize engineering solutions' ethical and social implications and make informed decisions in professional practice.
- Engage in lifelong learning through continuous professional development and advanced studies.

## Degree programs

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers the following undergraduate degrees:

- Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE)
- Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCE)
- Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering (BSBME)

### Electrical Engineering

The following is a suggested plan to complete the BSEE degree in four years. Meet with an academic advisor to create a plan that fits your educational needs best. Taking an average of 15 credit hours per semester facilitates timely graduation.

<!-- Table: See assets/ee_grad_table.tex for details -->

*The following alternatives are acceptable:*
- ECE 3510 Power Systems may be replaced by ECE 3610.
- ECE 5210 Digital Signal Processing may be taken instead of ECE 4100, though ECE 5210 is typically taught during the spring semester.

Acceptable Senior Electives are given below. Senior Electives are usually taught on an every-other-year basis.

<!-- Table: See assets/ee_electives_table.tex for details -->

Note: at most, one 3000-level course can be an acceptable Senior Level elective.

### Computer Engineering

The following is a suggested plan to complete the BSCE degree in four years. Meet with an academic advisor to create a plan that fits your educational needs best. Taking an average of 15 credit hours per semester facilitates timely graduation.

Acceptable Senior Electives are given below. Senior Electives are usually taught on an every-other-year basis.

<!-- Table: See assets/ce_electives_table.tex for details -->

Note: at most, one 3000-level course can be an acceptable Senior Level elective.

### Biomedical Engineering

The following is a suggested plan to complete the BSBME degree in four years. Meet with an academic advisor to create a plan that fits your educational needs best. Taking an average of 15 credit hours per semester facilitates timely graduation.

<!-- Table: See assets/bme_grad_table.tex for details -->

Acceptable Senior Electives are given below. Senior Electives are usually taught on an every-other-year basis.

Note: at most, one 3000-level course can be an acceptable Senior Level elective.

### Five-Year BS/MS Programs

Both the Electrical and Computer Engineering BS programs are designed to mesh with their corresponding MS programs to make it possible to complete a BS degree and an MS degree in 5 years (150 credits). Students must maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 and must still apply for admission to graduate school, but they need not supply transcripts or take the GRE.

Most senior electives offered by the department are cross-listed with graduate courses with a similar number. For example, ECE 5710 and ECE 6710 are both titled "Real-Time Systems," but ECE 5710 is a senior elective, and ECE 6710 is a graduate course. Both are taught at the same time and place, but the students in the graduate course are required to do additional work commensurate with the graduate level. Undergraduate students can take up to 2 graduate courses (a maximum of 6 credits) and count them toward their undergraduate and graduate degrees.

Students in the MS program may choose the option of writing a thesis, doing a project or taking additional courses. Those students who plan to pursue a graduate degree with the project option may select an undergraduate capstone project that will transition into a Master's project.

### Dual Majors

Students may earn a second bachelor's degree in EE, CE, or BME in conjunction with or after completing one EE, CE, or BME degree with the following provisos:

- The senior project may, with departmental approval, be shared between two degrees if it is (was) applicable to both. BME students must see an advisor to slot BME 4010/4020 instead of ECE 4010/4020 or vice versa.
- At most two 5000-level elective courses may be shared. (i.e., up to two 5000-level elective courses may be slotted simultaneously in both programs.) Courses that are not 5000-level may not be shared. Also, any course that fills a non-elective requirement in one program may not count as an elective in another.
- For students pursuing a second degree in Biomedical Engineering, at least one of the electives must come from outside the ECE department. (If the biomedical degree was initially completed without such a course, the student must take the outside course and count one of the prior electives as a non-shared elective for the EE or CE degree.)
- Students may not earn a triple major of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering.

### Independent Studies

Independent studies are available to students who wish to pursue a topic not covered in the regular curriculum. The student must find a faculty member willing to supervise the study and must submit a proposal to the department chair for approval by the ECE Department faculty. The proposal must include a description of the work to be done, the expected outcome, and the method of evaluation. The student must meet with the faculty member at least once a week and must submit a written report at the end of the semester. The number of credits earned is determined by the amount of work done, but the maximum is 3 credits per semester. Independent studies may not be used to satisfy the senior project requirement.
