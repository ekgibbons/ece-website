    or Judy Smith.</p>
<p>You may apply to the Professional Program before completing all the
    required courses in the Pre-Professional Program. This preliminary
    acceptance is contingent on completing the required courses with a C
    grade or better. A preliminary acceptance to the Professional Program
    will allow you to enroll in upper-division courses. If you have not
    completed a course in the pre-professional program, list the grade as a
    C when filling out the application and include that placeholder grade
    when computing your GPA. A GPA of 2.8 is still required for acceptance
    to the professional program. If your GPA falls below 2.8 with these
    placeholder C grades, wait until you have the final grades after taking
    the courses before you apply.</p>
<p>If you are a transfer student, please contact the program coordinator
    or advisors on how to fill out the application.</p>
<h3 id="dismissal-from-the-program">Dismissal from the program</h3>
<p>We are deeply committed to nurturing our students’ academic growth
    and success within the ECE Program. To maintain the rigorous standards
    and high-quality education our program offers, there is a specific
    policy concerning the repetition of courses.</p>
<p>Students in the pre-professional and professional programs may be
    placed on probation if they withdraw (without justification) or earn a
    grade lower than C twice in any one ECE course. Students on probation
    require a department override to register for any ECE course. If a
    student fails to pass a course (with a grade of C or higher) a third
    time, he or she will be dismissed from the program.</p>
<p>This will be implemented through the following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a student is in the Pre-Professional program, the student will
        not be eligible for admission into the Professional Program, thereby
        preventing the student from taking upper-division ECE courses.</li>
    <li>If a student is in the Professional Program, the student will be
        removed from the program and will not be allowed to take any further ECE
        courses.</li>
</ul>
<p>By upholding this standard, we provide a clear educational pathway to
    graduation, ensuring that our graduates from Weber State University are
    well-prepared and knowledgeable as they embark on a career in
    industry.</p>
<p>The policy encourages students to utilize the comprehensive support
    services available at Weber State University. We believe in offering a
    robust support system, including academic advising, tutoring, and
    counseling, to help students overcome obstacles and thrive in their
    studies. Seeking assistance promptly often enables students to address
    their concerns effectively, preventing the need for course repetition
    and allowing them to maintain their progress in the ECE Programs.</p>
<p>There is an established appeals process when students face
    exceptional circumstances that may have affected their academic
    performance. Students can provide relevant documentation and appeal to
    the Academic Review Board, ensuring that individual cases are thoroughly
    examined and decisions are made fairly and equitably.</p>
<p>By adhering to this policy, we uphold the reputation and integrity of
    Weber State University’s ECE Programs. This commitment ensures that our
    graduates possess exceptional technical skills and demonstrate
    resilience, determination, and adaptability, making them well-prepared
    for the challenges of the professional world in Electrical, Computer,
    and Biomedical Engineering.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h2>
<p>In the ECE Department, we uphold the highest academic integrity and
    ethical conduct standards. As future engineers and innovators, it is
    paramount that our students understand the significance of maintaining
    honesty, trust, and respect within the academic community. Academic
    integrity violations undermine our department’s core values and erode
    the foundation upon which our educational system is built.</p>
<p>One of our department’s specific areas of concern is the unauthorized
    sharing of course materials, including source code, assignments, and
    project files. While collaboration and knowledge sharing are encouraged
    within the boundaries of each course, students must recognize the
    importance of respecting the intellectual property rights associated
    with their coursework. This includes refraining from publicly posting
    course code or any other class-related materials, even after the course
    has concluded.</p>
<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
<p>Academic integrity violations are treated with the utmost seriousness
    in the ECE Department. Such actions compromise the learning process,
    diminish the value of the education received, and can lead to severe
    consequences. Students violating these policies may face disciplinary
    measures ranging from receiving a failing grade for the assignment or
    course to suspension or expulsion from the university. Additionally,
    academic integrity violations tarnish students’ reputations, potentially
    impacting their future career prospects and professional
    relationships.</p>
<h3 id="promoting-a-culture-of-integrity-and-responsibility">Promoting a
    culture of integrity and responsibility</h3>
<p>To promote a culture of academic integrity and responsibility, the
    ECE Department emphasizes the importance of understanding and abiding by
    university policies related to plagiarism, cheating, and unauthorized
    distribution of course materials. Faculty members employ various tools
    and techniques, including plagiarism detection software, to identify
    potential violations and ensure a fair and just academic environment for
    all students.</p>
<p>Furthermore, students are encouraged to actively engage with the
    principles of academic integrity and seek guidance from faculty members
    and academic advisors if they are uncertain about the appropriate
    collaboration and knowledge-sharing boundaries. By fostering an
    environment of open communication, mutual respect, and ethical conduct,
    we can collectively uphold the integrity of our department and nurture a
    community of engineers who are not only technically proficient but also
    ethically responsible leaders in their field.</p>
