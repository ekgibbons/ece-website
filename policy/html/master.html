    <p>Note: at most, one 3000-level course can be an acceptable Senior
        Level elective.</p>
    <h3 id="five-year-bsms-programs">Five-Year BS/MS Programs</h3>
    <p>Both the Electrical and Computer Engineering BS programs are designed
        to mesh with their corresponding MS programs to make it possible to
        complete a BS degree and an MS degree in 5 years (150 credits). Students
        must maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 and must still apply for admission
        to graduate school, but they need not supply transcripts or take the
        GRE.</p>
    <p>Most senior electives offered by the department are cross-listed with
        graduate courses with a similar number. For example, ECE 5710 and ECE
        6710 are both titled “Real-Time Systems,” but ECE 5710 is a senior
        elective, and ECE 6710 is a graduate course. Both are taught at the same
        time and place, but the students in the graduate course are required to
        do additional work commensurate with the graduate level. Undergraduate
        students can take up to 2 graduate courses (a maximum of 6 credits) and
        count them toward their undergraduate and graduate degrees.</p>
    <p>Students in the MS program may choose the option of writing a thesis,
        doing a project or taking additional courses. Those students who plan to
        pursue a graduate degree with the project option may select an
        undergraduate capstone project that will transition into a Master’s
        project.</p>
    <h3 id="dual-majors">Dual Majors</h3>
    <p>Students may earn a second bachelor’s degree in EE, CE, or BME in
        conjunction with or after completing one EE, CE, or BME degree with the
        following provisos:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The senior project may, with departmental approval, be shared
            between two degrees if it is (was) applicable to both. BME students must
            see an advisor to slot BME 4010/4020 instead of ECE 4010/4020 or vice
            versa.</li>
        <li>At most two 5000-level elective courses may be shared. (i.e., up to
            two 5000-level elective courses may be slotted simultaneously in both
            programs.) Courses that are not 5000-level may not be shared. Also, any
            course that fills a non-elective requirement in one program may not
            count as an elective in another.</li>
        <li>For students pursuing a second degree in Biomedical Engineering, at
            least one of the electives must come from outside the ECE department.
            (If the biomedical degree was initially completed without such a course,
            the student must take the outside course and count one of the prior
            electives as a non-shared elective for the EE or CE degree.)</li>
        <li>Students may not earn a triple major of Electrical, Computer, and
            Biomedical Engineering.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="independent-studies">Independent Studies</h3>
    <p>Independent studies are available to students who wish to pursue a
        topic not covered in the regular curriculum. The student must find a
        faculty member willing to supervise the study and must submit a proposal
        to the department chair for approval by the ECE Department faculty. The
        proposal must include a description of the work to be done, the expected
        outcome, and the method of evaluation. The student must meet with the
        faculty member at least once a week and must submit a written report at
        the end of the semester. The number of credits earned is determined by
        the amount of work done, but the maximum is 3 credits per semester.
        Independent studies may not be used to satisfy the senior project
        requirement.</p>

        C when filling out the application and include that placeholder grade
        when computing your GPA. A GPA of 2.8 is still required for acceptance
        to the professional program. If your GPA falls below 2.8 with these
        placeholder C grades, wait until you have the final grades after taking
        the courses before you apply.</p>
    <p>If you are a transfer student, please contact the program coordinator
        or advisors on how to fill out the application.</p>
    <h3 id="dismissal-from-the-program">Dismissal from the program</h3>
    <p>We are deeply committed to nurturing our students’ academic growth
        and success within the ECE Program. To maintain the rigorous standards
        and high-quality education our program offers, there is a specific
        policy concerning the repetition of courses.</p>
    <p>Students in the pre-professional and professional programs may be
        placed on probation if they withdraw (without justification) or earn a
        grade lower than C twice in any one ECE course. Students on probation
        require a department override to register for any ECE course. If a
        student fails to pass a course (with a grade of C or higher) a third
        time, he or she will be dismissed from the program.</p>
    <p>This will be implemented through the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If a student is in the Pre-Professional program, the student will
            not be eligible for admission into the Professional Program, thereby
            preventing the student from taking upper-division ECE courses.</li>
        <li>If a student is in the Professional Program, the student will be
            removed from the program and will not be allowed to take any further ECE
            courses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By upholding this standard, we provide a clear educational pathway to
        graduation, ensuring that our graduates from Weber State University are
        well-prepared and knowledgeable as they embark on a career in
        industry.</p>
    <p>The policy encourages students to utilize the comprehensive support
        services available at Weber State University. We believe in offering a
        robust support system, including academic advising, tutoring, and
        counseling, to help students overcome obstacles and thrive in their
        studies. Seeking assistance promptly often enables students to address
        their concerns effectively, preventing the need for course repetition
        and allowing them to maintain their progress in the ECE Programs.</p>
    <p>There is an established appeals process when students face
        exceptional circumstances that may have affected their academic
        performance. Students can provide relevant documentation and appeal to
        the Academic Review Board, ensuring that individual cases are thoroughly
        examined and decisions are made fairly and equitably.</p>
    <p>By adhering to this policy, we uphold the reputation and integrity of
        Weber State University’s ECE Programs. This commitment ensures that our
        graduates possess exceptional technical skills and demonstrate
        resilience, determination, and adaptability, making them well-prepared
        for the challenges of the professional world in Electrical, Computer,
        and Biomedical Engineering.</p>
    <h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h2>
    <p>In the ECE Department, we uphold the highest academic integrity and
        ethical conduct standards. As future engineers and innovators, it is
        paramount that our students understand the significance of maintaining
        honesty, trust, and respect within the academic community. Academic
        integrity violations undermine our department’s core values and erode
        the foundation upon which our educational system is built.</p>
    <p>One of our department’s specific areas of concern is the unauthorized
        sharing of course materials, including source code, assignments, and
        project files. While collaboration and knowledge sharing are encouraged
        within the boundaries of each course, students must recognize the
        importance of respecting the intellectual property rights associated
        with their coursework. This includes refraining from publicly posting
        course code or any other class-related materials, even after the course
        has concluded.</p>
    <h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
    <p>Academic integrity violations are treated with the utmost seriousness
        in the ECE Department. Such actions compromise the learning process,
        diminish the value of the education received, and can lead to severe
        consequences. Students violating these policies may face disciplinary
        measures ranging from receiving a failing grade for the assignment or
        course to suspension or expulsion from the university. Additionally,
        academic integrity violations tarnish students’ reputations, potentially
        impacting their future career prospects and professional
        relationships.</p>
    <h3 id="promoting-a-culture-of-integrity-and-responsibility">Promoting a
        culture of integrity and responsibility</h3>
    <p>To promote a culture of academic integrity and responsibility, the
        ECE Department emphasizes the importance of understanding and abiding by
        university policies related to plagiarism, cheating, and unauthorized
        distribution of course materials. Faculty members employ various tools
        and techniques, including plagiarism detection software, to identify
        potential violations and ensure a fair and just academic environment for
        all students.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, students are encouraged to actively engage with the
        principles of academic integrity and seek guidance from faculty members
        and academic advisors if they are uncertain about the appropriate
        collaboration and knowledge-sharing boundaries. By fostering an
        environment of open communication, mutual respect, and ethical conduct,
        we can collectively uphold the integrity of our department and nurture a
        community of engineers who are not only technically proficient but also
        ethically responsible leaders in their field.</p>
    <h3 id="examples-of-academic-misbehavior">Examples of academic
        misbehavior</h3>
    <p>The following is an incomplete list of examples of academic
        misbehavior. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and other
        forms of academic integrity violations may occur. It serves as a handful
        of examples to highlight the various violations students should be aware
        of.</p>
