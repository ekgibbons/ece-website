        professional and respectful environment.</p>
    <h2 id="policy-details">Policy Details</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Office Hours:</strong> Faculty members will specify regular
            office hours during which students are welcome to visit without a prior
            appointment. Students can seek assistance, guidance, or academic support
            during these designated hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduled Appointments:</strong> Students must arrange
            appointments in advance to meet faculty outside office hours. Faculty
            members are encouraged to communicate their availability and to schedule
            appointments with students where appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> Students should not go beyond the
            reception area unless they have an appointment or to visit a faculty
            member during designated office hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect for Privacy:</strong> If a faculty member’s office
            door is closed, students must respect his or her privacy (and
            potentially that of another student) and not attempt to open the door. A
            student may knock once lightly to let the faculty member know he or she
            is waiting.</li>
        <li><strong>Front Desk Assistance:</strong> Students requiring
            assistance should approach the front desk, where department staff will
            be available to address general inquiries, provide guidance on
            scheduling appointments, or check the availability of faculty
            members.</li>

        removing parts from oscilloscope probes may result in losing lab
        privileges.</p>
    <h2 id="lab-etiquette-1">Lab etiquette</h2>
    <p>Maintain a quiet and focused environment in the lab to facilitate
        learning and concentration. Headphones should be used for audio to avoid
        disturbing others. Food and beverages are prohibited near the lab
        equipment to prevent spills and damage. Personal belongings should not
        be placed on chair seats or left unattended in the lab.</p>
    <h2 id="consequences-of-violation-1">Consequences of violation</h2>
    <p>Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary actions,
        including but not limited to loss of lab privileges, academic penalties,
        and further consequences as determined by the instructor or
        department.</p>
    <h2 id="specialty-lab">Specialty lab</h2>
    <p>Lab policies for specialty labs, such as the Optics Lab, Microscopy
        and Microfabrication Lab, and Electromagnetics Lab are outlined
        below.</p>
    <h2 id="lab-access-1">Lab access</h2>

    <h2 id="security-1">Security</h2>
    <p>The lab contains many delicate items of high value. Many instruments
        are temperature- and environment-controlled, so the doors must always
        remain shut. The lab must remain locked at all times, and no access must
        be granted to anyone without the express consent of ECE faculty.</p>
    <h2 id="consequences-of-violation-2">Consequences of violation</h2>
    <p>Violations of this policy may result in temporary or permanent
        suspension of lab access privileges or disciplinary actions deemed
        appropriate by the Dean of Students.</p>
    <h2 id="robotics-and-power-lab">Robotics and Power Lab</h2>
    <p>The Robotics and Power Lab in room NB136 contains all of the
        equipment for the power systems and robotics courses.</p>
    <h2 id="lab-access-2">Lab access</h2>
    <p><strong>Power:</strong> Due to the potentially dangerous nature of
        the power equipment, students in power courses will only be granted
        access to the lab during scheduled, supervised lab times. Students are
        never allowed to operate any power station equipment unless an
        instructor is present.</p>
    <p><strong>Robotics:</strong> Students in the robotics classes will be
        granted card access to the lab outside the scheduled lab sessions;
        however, general access is prohibited when any other scheduled lab uses
        the room.</p>
    <h2 id="responsible-use-1">Responsible use</h2>
    <p><strong>Power:</strong> Every power station must be returned to a
        clean state with all wires removed and properly stored on the racks. All
        meters and test equipment must be stored in the cabinet and drawer
        beside the table. The motors and breaks may be left on the platform for
        future use. Any additional equipment must be returned to the
        shelves.</p>
    <p><strong>Robotics:</strong> The robotics students may use any work
        table but must leave the power equipment as-is. All robotics hardware
        must be properly stored in the cabinets or shelves.</p>
    <h2 id="food-and-beverages-2">Food and beverages</h2>
    <p>No food or beverages are allowed in the power lab at any time.</p>
    <h2 id="security-2">Security</h2>
    <p>The lab contains many items of high value. The lab must remain
        locked, and no access must be granted to students not enrolled in the
        courses. All power stations and robotics hardware will be inventoried,
        and students will be liable for missing items.</p>
    <h2 id="consequences-of-violation-3">Consequences of violation</h2>
    <p>Violations of this policy may result in temporary or permanent
        suspension of lab access privileges or disciplinary actions deemed
