<h1 id="program-overview">Program overview</h1>
<h2 id="mission-and-goals">Mission and goals</h2>
<p>The mission of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)
department at Weber State is to educate students to become skilled and
innovative engineers who contribute effectively to society. Our programs
aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of electrical, computer,
and biomedical engineering principles, foster critical thinking and
problem-solving skills, and prepare graduates for successful careers in
various industries or advanced studies in graduate school.</p>
<h3 id="program-learning-outcomes">Program learning outcomes</h3>
<p>Upon completion of the ECE programs, students are expected to
demonstrate the following learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply mathematical, scientific, and engineering principles to solve
complex electrical, computer, or biomedical engineering problems.</li>
<li>Design and conduct experiments and analyze and interpret data in
electrical, computer, or biomedical engineering domains.</li>
<li>Design systems and components and integrate them into complex,
realistic contexts.</li>
<li>Work effectively in multidisciplinary teams, demonstrating
communication, leadership, and project management skills.</li>
<li>Recognize engineering solutions’ ethical and social implications and
make informed decisions in professional practice.</li>
<li>Engage in lifelong learning through continuous professional
development and advanced studies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="degree-programs">Degree programs</h2>
<p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers the
following undergraduate degrees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE)</li>
<li>Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCE)</li>
<li>Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering (BSBME)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="electrical-engineering">Electrical Engineering</h3>
<p>The following is a suggested plan to complete the BSEE degree in four
years. Meet with an academic advisor to create a plan that fits your
educational needs best. Taking an average of 15 credit hours per
semester facilitates timely graduation.</p>
<!-- Table: See assets/ee_grad_table.tex for details -->
<p><em>The following alternatives are acceptable:</em> - ECE 3510 Power
Systems may be replaced by ECE 3610. - ECE 5210 Digital Signal
Processing may be taken instead of ECE 4100, though ECE 5210 is
typically taught during the spring semester.</p>
<p>Acceptable Senior Electives are given below. Senior Electives are
usually taught on an every-other-year basis.</p>
<!-- Table: See assets/ee_electives_table.tex for details -->
<p>Note: at most, one 3000-level course can be an acceptable Senior
Level elective.</p>
<h3 id="computer-engineering">Computer Engineering</h3>
<p>The following is a suggested plan to complete the BSCE degree in four
years. Meet with an academic advisor to create a plan that fits your
educational needs best. Taking an average of 15 credit hours per
semester facilitates timely graduation.</p>
<!-- Table: See assets/ce_grad_table.tex for details -->
<p>Acceptable Senior Electives are given below. Senior Electives are
usually taught on an every-other-year basis.</p>
<!-- Table: See assets/ce_electives_table.tex for details -->
<p>Note: at most, one 3000-level course can be an acceptable Senior
Level elective.</p>
<h3 id="biomedical-engineering">Biomedical Engineering</h3>
<p>The following is a suggested plan to complete the BSBME degree in
four years. Meet with an academic advisor to create a plan that fits
your educational needs best. Taking an average of 15 credit hours per
semester facilitates timely graduation.</p>
<!-- Table: See assets/bme_grad_table.tex for details -->
<p>Acceptable Senior Electives are given below. Senior Electives are
usually taught on an every-other-year basis.</p>
<!-- Table: See assets/bme_electives_table.tex for details -->
<p>Note: at most, one 3000-level course can be an acceptable Senior
Level elective.</p>
<h3 id="five-year-bsms-programs">Five-Year BS/MS Programs</h3>
<p>Both the Electrical and Computer Engineering BS programs are designed
to mesh with their corresponding MS programs to make it possible to
complete a BS degree and an MS degree in 5 years (150 credits). Students
must maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 and must still apply for admission
to graduate school, but they need not supply transcripts or take the
GRE.</p>
<p>Most senior electives offered by the department are cross-listed with
graduate courses with a similar number. For example, ECE 5710 and ECE
6710 are both titled “Real-Time Systems,” but ECE 5710 is a senior
elective, and ECE 6710 is a graduate course. Both are taught at the same
time and place, but the students in the graduate course are required to
do additional work commensurate with the graduate level. Undergraduate
students can take up to 2 graduate courses (a maximum of 6 credits) and
count them toward their undergraduate and graduate degrees.</p>
<p>Students in the MS program may choose the option of writing a thesis,
doing a project or taking additional courses. Those students who plan to
pursue a graduate degree with the project option may select an
undergraduate capstone project that will transition into a Master’s
project.</p>
<h3 id="dual-majors">Dual Majors</h3>
<p>Students may earn a second bachelor’s degree in EE, CE, or BME in
conjunction with or after completing one EE, CE, or BME degree with the
following provisos:</p>
<ul>
<li>The senior project may, with departmental approval, be shared
between two degrees if it is (was) applicable to both. BME students must
see an advisor to slot BME 4010/4020 instead of ECE 4010/4020 or vice
versa.</li>
<li>At most two 5000-level elective courses may be shared. (i.e., up to
two 5000-level elective courses may be slotted simultaneously in both
programs.) Courses that are not 5000-level may not be shared. Also, any
course that fills a non-elective requirement in one program may not
count as an elective in another.</li>
<li>For students pursuing a second degree in Biomedical Engineering, at
least one of the electives must come from outside the ECE department.
(If the biomedical degree was initially completed without such a course,
the student must take the outside course and count one of the prior
electives as a non-shared elective for the EE or CE degree.)</li>
<li>Students may not earn a triple major of Electrical, Computer, and
Biomedical Engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="independent-studies">Independent Studies</h3>
<p>Independent studies are available to students who wish to pursue a
topic not covered in the regular curriculum. The student must find a
faculty member willing to supervise the study and must submit a proposal
to the department chair for approval by the ECE Department faculty. The
proposal must include a description of the work to be done, the expected
outcome, and the method of evaluation. The student must meet with the
faculty member at least once a week and must submit a written report at
the end of the semester. The number of credits earned is determined by
the amount of work done, but the maximum is 3 credits per semester.
Independent studies may not be used to satisfy the senior project
requirement.</p>
